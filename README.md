Project: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
This repository demonstrates the use of GitHub Actions to automate Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) workflows for a simple software project.

The purpose of this repository is to set up a CI pipeline that automatically runs tests and builds the project on every push to the main branch. Additionally, it implements a CD pipeline to automatically deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku) after successful testing.

This project serves as an educational exercise to practice using GitHub Actions for automating software development processes, ensuring that the application is continuously tested and deployed with minimal manual intervention.
